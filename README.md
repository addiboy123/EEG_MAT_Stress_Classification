This study aims at improving the existing DL model accuracies on mental stress classification using EEG Physiological signals.
The models have been trained & tested on following datasets:-
1. EEG During Mental Arithmetic Tasks- https://physionet.org/content/eegmat/1.0.0/
2. SAM 40: Dataset of 40 Subject EEG Recordings to Monitor the Induced-Stress while performing Stroop Color-Word Test, Arithmetic Task, and Mirror Image Recognition Task - https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14562090.v1
