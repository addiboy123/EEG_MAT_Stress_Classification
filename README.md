This study aims at improving the existing DL model accuracies on mental stress classification using EEG Physiological signals.

Following Features were Extracted-
  Set A :
  + Hjorth activity TD
  + Hjorth complexity TD
  + Hjorth mobility TD
  + Higuchi Fractal Dimension TD
  + AlphaBeta Ratios FD
  + ThetaAlpha Ratios FD
  + Relative Bandpower FD
  + Spectral Entropy TD
  + Sample Entropy TD

  Set B : 
  + Slope entropy features  TD
  + Dispersion entropy features TD
  + Permutation entropy features TD
  + Shanon entropy features TD
  + Spectral entropy features TD

Following Models have been explored-
1. LSTM
2. CNN
3. Hybrid(LSTM +CNN)

The models have been trained & tested on following datasets:-
1. EEG During Mental Arithmetic Tasks- https://physionet.org/content/eegmat/1.0.0/
2. SAM 40: Dataset of 40 Subject EEG Recordings to Monitor the Induced-Stress while performing Stroop Color-Word Test, Arithmetic Task, and Mirror Image Recognition Task - https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14562090.v1
